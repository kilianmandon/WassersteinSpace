abstract={The optimal weak transport problem has recently been introduced by Gozlan et al. (J Funct Anal 273(11):3327--3405, 2017). We provide general existence and duality results for these problems on arbitrary Polish spaces, as well as a necessary and sufficient optimality criterion in the spirit of cyclical monotonicity. As an application we extend the Brenier--Strassen Theorem of Gozlan and Juillet (On a mixture of brenier and strassen theorems. arXiv:1808.02681, 2018) to general probability measures on {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mathbb {\{}R{\}}^d{\$}{\$} under minimal assumptions. A driving idea behind our proofs is to consider the set of transport plans with a new (`adapted') topology which seems better suited for the weak transport problem and allows to carry out arguments which are close to the proofs in the classical setup.},
